# API Logging Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced logging has been added to the yt-dlp API to provide comprehensive visibility into request processing and download operations.

## What's Logged Now

### 1. Request Tracking
Every API request now logs:
- **Request received**: Method, path, client IP, and User-Agent
- **Request body**: URL being processed and format preferences
- **Response status**: HTTP status code and processing time
- **Clear separators**: Visual separators (====) between requests for easy reading

### 2. Download Progress
During video downloads, you'll see:
- **Start of download**: Full URL, format preference, and limits
- **Video metadata**: Title, duration, uploader
- **Progress updates**: Download percentage, speed, and ETA
- **Completion status**: File size, location, and success confirmation

### 3. Server Startup
On server start, logs show:
- Environment (production/development)
- Download directory location
- Maximum file size limits
- File cleanup schedule
- API key configuration status

### 4. Health Checks
Health check requests are also logged to track monitoring activity

## Gunicorn Configuration
The Docker container now runs gunicorn with these logging flags:
- `--access-logfile -`: Logs all HTTP access to stdout
- `--error-logfile -`: Logs all errors to stdout
- `--log-level info`: Sets log level to INFO
- `--capture-output`: Captures all Python print/logging output

## Viewing Logs on Render.com

After deploying these changes, you'll be able to see in your Render.com logs:
1. When each request is received with the full URL
2. Download progress with percentage completion
3. Success/failure status with clear indicators
4. Processing time for each request
5. Any errors with full stack traces

The logs will show clear visual separators between requests, making it easy to track individual API calls from start to finish.

## Deployment

To deploy these changes:
1. Commit the changes to your repository
2. Push to the branch connected to Render.com
3. Render will automatically rebuild and deploy with the new logging

After deployment, your logs will show comprehensive information about every API request and download operation.
